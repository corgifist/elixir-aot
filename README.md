<h1><p align="center">ElixirAOT [Heavy work in progress!]</p></h1>
<p align="center">ElixirAOT is a tool for converting ElixirAOT to CPP code, so you can then compile it with native executable!</p>

ElixirAOT is useful for:
* Accessing low-level or OS-specific functions via Elixir code
* Boosting up your code (situation-specific)
* Combining Elixir cnd CPP code together
* Packaging your project for release (compile to single native executable)

ElixirAOT contains a whole rewrite of Elixir standard library in CPP (hard work in progress), so it can be used in CPP code!
